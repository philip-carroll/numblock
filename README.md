# Numblock
Numblock is a free and addictive block puzzle game. The object of the game is to direct falling Numblocks into columns as they land. Earn points by reducing a column total to zero. As the levels increase, so does the difficulty and speed at which Numblocks fall. Allow a Numblock to fall into a column with a smaller total than the Numblock and the game is over!
