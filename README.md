# Numblock
Numblock is a free and addictive block puzzle game. The object of the game is to direct falling Numblocks into columns as they land. Earn points by reducing a column total to zero. As the levels increase, so does the difficulty and speed at which Numblocks fall. Allow a Numblock to fall into a column with a smaller total than the Numblock and the game is over!

## Install
You can download the Numblock app [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PhilipCarroll.Numblock) from the Google Play Store.
